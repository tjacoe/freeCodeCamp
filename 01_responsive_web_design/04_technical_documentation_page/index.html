                <div class="content">
                    <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.</li>
                        <li>CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</li>
                        <li>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a simple text label as an example. We can mark it up using HTML to give it structure and purpose:</p>
                    <pre class="html-code"><code><p>
&#60;p&#62;Player 1: Chris&#60;/p&#62;
                    </p></code></pre>
                    <p>Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:</p>
                    <pre class="html-code"><code><p>
p {
    font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif;
    letter-spacing: 1px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    text-align: center;
    border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
    background: rgba(0,0,200,0.3);
    color: rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
    box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,200,0.4);
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 3px 10px;
    display: inline-block;
    cursor: pointer;
}
                    </p></code></pre>
                    <p>And finally, we can add some JavaScript to implement dynamic behaviour:</p>
                    <pre class="html-code"><code><p>
var para = document.querySelector('p');

para.addEventListener('click', updateName);

function updateName() {
  var name = prompt('Enter a new name');
  para.textContent = 'Player 1: ' + name;
}
                    </p></code></pre>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Thinking_like_a_programmer">
                <header id="Thinking_like_a_programmer">Thinking like a programmer</header>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>One of the hardest things to learn in programming is not the syntax you need to learn, but how to apply it to solve real world problems. You need to start thinking like a programmer — this generally involves looking at descriptions of what your program needs to do,  working out what code features are needed to achieve those things, and how to make them work together.</p>
                    <p>This requires a mixture of hard work, experience with the programming syntax, and practice — plus a bit of creativity. The more you code, the better you'll get at it. We can't promise that you'll develop "programmer brain" in five minutes, but we will give you plenty of opportunity to practice thinking like a programmer throughout the course.</p>
                    <p>With that in mind, let's look at the example we'll be building up in this article, and review the general process of dissecting it into tangible tasks.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Types_of_error">
                <header id="Types_of_error">Types of error</header>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Generally speaking, when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of error that you'll come across:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!</li>
                        <li>Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't a resulting error message to direct you to the source of the error.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Storing_the_information_you_need">
                <header id="Storing_the_information_you_need">Storing the information you need</header>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence. But one special thing about variables is that their contained values can change. Let's look at a simple example:</p>
                    <pre class="html-code"><code><p>
&#60;button&#62;Press me&#60;/button&#62;
                    </p></code></pre>
                    <pre class="html-code"><code><p>
var button = document.querySelector('button');

button.onclick = function() {
  var name = prompt('What is your name?');
  alert('Hello ' + name + ', nice to see you!');
}
                    </p></code></pre>
                    <p>Variables just make sense, and as you learn more about JavaScript they will start to become second nature.</p>
                    <p>Another special thing about variables is that they can contain just about anything — not just strings and numbers. Variables can also contain complex data and even entire functions to do amazing things. You'll learn more about this as you go along.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Strings_in_JavaScript">
                <header id="Strings_in_JavaScript">Strings in JavaScript</header>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Strings are dealt with similarly to numbers at first glance, but when you dig deeper you'll start to see some notable differences. Let's start by entering some basic lines into a console to familiarize ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Concatenate is a fancy programming word that means "join together". Joining together strings in JavaScript uses the plus (+) operator, the same one we use to add numbers together, but in this context it does something different.</p>
